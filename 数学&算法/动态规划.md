dp solved each sub-problem and saved answers in a table to avoid re-computing the answer

to develop dp problem,follow four step:
1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.
2. Recursively define the value of an optimal solution
3. compute the value of an  optimal solution,typically in a bootom-up fasion.
4. construct an optimal solution from computed information.
