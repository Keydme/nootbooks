bayes' rule
![[img/Pasted image 20240216160042.png]]

Bayes’ rule is the fundamental mathematical ingredient of a subjective, or “Bayesian,” approach to epistemology, theories of evidence, and theories of learning. According to this point of view, an individual’s beliefs about the world can be coded in probabilities. For example, an individual’s belief that it will hail tomorrow can be represented by a probability P(H). This probability varies from individual to indi-vidual. In principle, each individual’s probability can be ascertained, or elicited, by offering him or her a series of bets at different odds.
